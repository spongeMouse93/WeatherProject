# WeatherProject

This is my first HTML/CSS/Javascript project to work with APIs. In this case, the user types in the name of a city and the program tells the user the weather in that city currently, stating the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit and giving more details about the weather (clear, cloudy, raining, etc). The API gives the temperature in Kelvins, but my program converts it into degrees Fahrenheit.
